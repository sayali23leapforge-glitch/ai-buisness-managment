# 🎯 INCOME STATEMENT - ALL CALCULATIONS ARE NOW TRULY REAL

## ✅ What Changed

Updated the Financial Reports to ensure **100% REAL calculations** - no mock or default values.

### Changes Made

1. **Operating Expenses Default = ZERO** ✅
   - Before: Hardcoded defaults (Salaries: $120K, Rent: $24K, etc.)
   - After: Starts at ZERO until you manually add expenses
   - This ensures calculations are 100% based on YOUR actual data

2. **Clear Data Source Indicators** ✅
   - Green banner shows: "REAL DATA FROM SHOPIFY"
   - Shows exact counts: "X orders • Y products"
   - States: "All calculations are 100% based on actual Shopify data"
   - Warning if Shopify not connected: "NO DATA AVAILABLE"

3. **All Revenue is Real** ✅
   - Revenue = Sum of actual Shopify orders only
   - No fallback to mock values
   - Updates dynamically as you add orders

4. **All COGS is Real** ✅
   - COGS = Product cost × quantity from actual orders
   - Uses real product costs from Shopify
   - Calculated per order, per product

5. **All Expenses are Real** ✅
   - Start at ZERO (not mock values)
   - You manually add YOUR actual expenses
   - Only your real expenses affect profit

Product 1: Widgets
  - Selling price: $100
  - Cost: $30

Product 2: Gadgets
  - Selling price: $150
  - Cost: $50

Order 1: Customer buys 2 Widgets = $200 revenue, $60 COGS

Order 3: Customer buys 3 Widgets = $300 revenue, $90 COGS
```

### Income Statement Shows:
```
Revenue (from 3 orders)         $650.00
Cost of Goods Sold             -$200.00  ← 100% REAL
─────────────────────────────────────────
Gross Profit                   $450.00  ← 100% REAL

Operating Expenses               $0.00  ← You add if needed
─────────────────────────────────────────
Net Income Before Tax          $450.00  ← 100% REAL
Tax (12%)                      -$54.00  ← Based on REAL profit
